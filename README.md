# 💼 Salary Prediction for Data Science Roles

This project was developed for TechHire Recruiting Firm to identify key trends in data science salaries and improve hiring recommendations. We analyzed roles, experience levels, work types, and geography using predictive modeling to uncover what drives compensation.

## 🎯 Goal
Support TechHire in building competitive pay structures for top data science talent using data-driven insights and modeling.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle’s Data Science Salaries 2024 dataset
- **Size:** 1,000+ entries across job titles, locations, work types, experience levels, and company sizes

## 🧪 Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis (scatter plots, box plots, bar charts)
- Preprocessing: one-hot encoding, normalization
- Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Gradient Boosting** was the best predictive model across all evaluations
- Senior-level and executive roles command significantly higher salaries
- Fully remote roles have more consistent and higher salary ranges
- High-paying roles include Research Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers
